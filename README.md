My Admin Dashboard project!

Honestly, it took less time to finish than I'd thought. The main reason for that is that I'd prepared a proper plan and pseudocode for this project beforehand. I hadn't done it before so I wasn't aware of HOW MUCH this "little thing" CHANGES the work-flow! At first I struggled to properly outline elements, but once I got a grasp on idea it went so smoothly. From now on, definitely before any project, that's the first thing to do.

I really am proud of my result, however I know there is a lot to improve. For now, I'll give myself a passing grade and move on to tackle the next tasks.

I'll be back, though.

Thank you TOP! This one was a real fun!
